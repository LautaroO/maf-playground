# MafPlayground.Studio

Development-only inspection services over the application's normal AI runtime
registrations. This library references Abstractions and Runtime, with no Samples,
CLI or concrete-provider dependency. Register `AddStudioCatalog()` in the same
service collection as `AddAIRuntime(...)`, then resolve `IStudioCatalog` in a scope.

The catalog reads `IAIEntityRegistry.Entities` and optional Runtime inspection
metadata. Input/output JSON schemas and examples use `AIJsonSerializerOptions.Default`,
matching the generic typed invoker. Missing examples or native capabilities never
exclude an entity. Configuration-only availability checks can disable a particular
entity with a reason, without relaxing the application's strict startup validation.
Catalog enumeration does not construct entities, agents, or native sources.

Native workflow topology comes from the normally registered `IMafWorkflowSource`.
The opaque profile ID is forwarded to its factory with the current service scope;
the host owns profile binding. Source construction must be safe for inspection:
no model/tool execution or eager client construction. Agents and workflows lacking
a native source return an explicit topology-unavailable state.

MAF 1.16 public `ReflectExecutors`, `ReflectEdges`, and `StartExecutorId` expose
structural graph metadata, including fan-out, fan-in and cycles. `EdgeInfo` omits
labels and runtime edge identities. Studio derives stable structural edge IDs,
coalesces indistinguishable structural connections, and reports labels as
unavailable. The native Mermaid export retains available labels as an opaque
export; Studio does not parse it or reflect private framework fields.
